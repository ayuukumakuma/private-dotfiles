# [Billing](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/billing.html#billing)

This page covers billing for Zed's [subscription plans](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/subscription.html). For details on what's included in each plan and how token usage works, see [Plans and Usage](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/plans-and-usage.html).

We use Stripe as our payments provider, and Orb for invoicing and metering. All Pro plans require payment via credit card or other supported payment method.
For invoice-based billing, a Business plan is required. Contact [sales@zed.dev](mailto:sales@zed.dev) for more information.

## [Billing Information](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/billing.html#settings)

Access billing information and settings at [dashboard.zed.dev/account](https://dashboard.zed.dev/account).
This page embeds data from Orb, our invoicing and metering partner.

## [Billing Cycles](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/billing.html#billing-cycles)

Zed is billed on a monthly basis based on the date you initially subscribe. You'll receive *at least* one invoice from Zed each month you're subscribed to Zed Pro, and more than one if you use more than $10 in incremental token spend within the month.

## [Threshold Billing](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/billing.html#threshold-billing)

Zed utilizes threshold billing to ensure timely collection of owed monies and prevent abuse. Every time your usage of Zed's hosted models crosses a $10 spend threshold, a new invoice is generated, and the threshold resets to $0.

For example,

* You subscribe on February 1. Your first invoice is $10.
* You use $12 of incremental tokens in the month of February, with the first $10 spent on February 15. You'll receive an invoice for $10 on February 15
* On March 1, you receive an invoice for $12: $10 (March Pro subscription) and $2 in leftover token spend, since your usage didn't cross the $10 threshold.

## [Payment Failures](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/billing.html#payment-failures)

If payment of an invoice fails, Zed will block usage of our hosted models until the payment is complete. Email [billing-support@zed.dev](mailto:billing-support@zed.dev) for assistance.

## [Invoice History](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/billing.html#invoice-history)

You can access your invoice history by navigating to [dashboard.zed.dev/account](https://dashboard.zed.dev/account) and clicking `Invoice history` within the embedded Orb portal.

If you require historical Stripe invoices, email [billing-support@zed.dev](mailto:billing-support@zed.dev)

## [Updating Billing Information](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/billing.html#updating-billing-info)

Email [billing-support@zed.dev](mailto:billing-support@zed.dev) for help updating payment methods, names, addresses, and tax information.

> Self-service billing updates will be available in a future release.

Please note that changes to billing information will **only** affect future invoices — **we cannot modify historical invoices**.

## [Sales Tax](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/billing.html#sales-tax)

Zed partners with [Sphere](https://www.getsphere.com/) to calculate indirect tax rate for invoices, based on customer location and the product being sold. Tax is listed as a separate line item on invoices, based preferentially on your billing address, followed by the card issue country known to Stripe.

If you have a VAT/GST ID, you can add it at during checkout. Check the box that denotes you as a business.

Please note that changes to VAT/GST IDs and address will **only** affect future invoices — **we cannot modify historical invoices**.
Questions or issues can be directed to [billing-support@zed.dev](mailto:billing-support@zed.dev).
