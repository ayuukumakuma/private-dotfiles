# [Tools](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#tools)

Zed's built-in agent has access to these tools for reading, searching, and editing your codebase. These tools are used in the [Agent Panel](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/agent-panel.html) during conversations with AI agents.

You can configure permissions for tool actions, including situations where they are automatically approved, automatically denied, or require your confirmation on a case-by-case basis. See [Tool Permissions](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tool-permissions.html) for the list of permission-gated tools and details.

To add custom tools beyond these built-in ones, see [MCP servers](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/mcp.html).

## [Read & Search Tools](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#read--search-tools)

### [`diagnostics`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#diagnostics)

Gets errors and warnings for either a specific file or the entire project, useful after making edits to determine if further changes are needed.
When a path is provided, shows all diagnostics for that specific file.
When no path is provided, shows a summary of error and warning counts for all files in the project.

**Example:** After editing `src/parser.rs`, call `diagnostics` with that path to check for type errors immediately. After a larger refactor touching many files, call it without a path to see a project-wide count of errors before deciding what to fix next.

### [`fetch`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#fetch)

Fetches a URL and returns the content as Markdown. Useful for providing docs as context.

**Example:** Fetching a library's changelog page to check whether a breaking API change was introduced in a recent version before writing integration code.

### [`find_path`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#find_path)

Quickly finds files by matching glob patterns (like "\**/*.js"), returning matching file paths alphabetically.

### [`grep`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#grep)

Searches file contents across the project using regular expressions, preferred for finding symbols in code without knowing exact file paths.

**Example:** To find every call site of a function before renaming it, search for `parse_config\(` — the regex matches the function name followed by an opening parenthesis, filtering out comments or variable names that happen to contain the string.

### [`list_directory`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#list_directory)

Lists files and directories in a given path, providing an overview of filesystem contents.

### [`now`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#now)

Returns the current date and time.

### [`open`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#open)

Opens a file or URL with the default application associated with it on the user's operating system.

### [`read_file`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#read_file)

Reads the content of a specified file in the project, allowing access to file contents.

### [`thinking`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#thinking)

Allows the Agent to work through problems, brainstorm ideas, or plan without executing actions, useful for complex problem-solving.

### [`web_search`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#web_search)

Searches the web for information, providing results with snippets and links from relevant web pages, useful for accessing real-time information.

**Example:** Looking up whether a known bug in a dependency has been patched in a recent release, or finding the current API signature for a third-party library when the local docs are out of date.

## [Edit Tools](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#edit-tools)

### [`copy_path`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#copy_path)

Copies a file or directory recursively in the project, more efficient than manually reading and writing files when duplicating content.

### [`create_directory`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#create_directory)

Creates a new directory at the specified path within the project, creating all necessary parent directories (similar to `mkdir -p`).

### [`delete_path`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#delete_path)

Deletes a file or directory (including contents recursively) at the specified path and confirms the deletion.

### [`edit_file`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#edit_file)

Edits files by replacing specific text with new content.

**Example:** Updating a function signature — the agent identifies the exact lines to replace and provides the updated version, leaving the surrounding code untouched. For widespread renames, it pairs this with `grep` to find every occurrence first.

### [`move_path`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#move_path)

Moves or renames a file or directory in the project, performing a rename if only the filename differs.

### [`restore_file_from_disk`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#restore_file_from_disk)

Discards unsaved changes in open buffers by reloading file contents from disk. Useful for resetting files to their on-disk state before retrying an edit.

### [`save_file`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#save_file)

Saves files that have unsaved changes. Used when files need to be saved before further edits can be made.

### [`terminal`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#terminal)

Executes shell commands and returns the combined output, creating a new shell process for each invocation.

**Example:** After editing a Rust file, run `cargo test --package my_crate 2>&1 | tail -30` to confirm the changes don't break existing tests. Or run `git diff --stat` to review which files have been modified before wrapping up a task.

## [Other Tools](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#other-tools)

### [`spawn_agent`](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tools.html#spawn_agent)

Spawns a subagent with its own context window to perform a delegated task. Useful for running parallel investigations, completing self-contained tasks, or performing research where only the outcome matters. Each subagent has access to the same tools as the parent agent.

**Example:** While refactoring the authentication module, spawn a subagent to investigate how session tokens are validated elsewhere in the codebase. The parent agent continues its work and reviews the subagent's findings when it completes — keeping both context windows focused on a single task.
