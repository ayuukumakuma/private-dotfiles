### [Hints](https://just.systems/man/en/hints.html#hints)

Here are some hints to get you started with specific kinds of new features,
which you can use in addition to the contribution workflow above.

#### [Adding a New Attribute](https://just.systems/man/en/hints.html#adding-a-new-attribute)

1. Write a new integration test in
   [tests/attributes.rs](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/tests/attributes.rs).
2. Add a new variant to the
   [`Attribute`](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/src/attribute.rs)
   enum.
3. Implement the functionality of the new attribute.
4. Run `just ci` to make sure that all tests pass.
