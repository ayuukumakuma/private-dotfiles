# [Dev Containers](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers.html#dev-containers)

Dev Containers provide a consistent, reproducible development environment by defining your project's dependencies, tools, and settings in a container configuration.

If your repository includes a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file, Zed can open a project inside a development container.

## [Requirements](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers.html#requirements)

* Docker must be installed and available in your `PATH`. Zed requires the `docker` command to be present. If you use Podman, you must alias it to `docker`, e.g. by using a symlink: `sudo ln -s $(which podman) {some_known_path}/docker`.
* Your project must contain a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` directory/file.

## [Using Dev Containers in Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers.html#using-dev-containers-in-zed)

### [Automatic prompt](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers.html#automatic-prompt)

When you open a project that contains the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` directory/file, Zed will display a prompt asking whether to open the project inside the dev container. Choosing "Open in Container" will:

1. Build the dev container image (if needed).
2. Launch the container.
3. Reopen the project connected to the container environment.

### [Manual open](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers.html#manual-open)

If you dismiss the prompt or want to reopen the project inside a container later, you can use Zed's command palette to run the "Project: Open Remote" command and select the option to open the project in a dev container.
Alternatively, you can reach for the Remote Projects modal (through the `ctrl-cmd-shift-o|alt-ctrl-shift-o` binding) and choose the "Connect Dev Container" option.

## [Editing the dev container configuration](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers.html#editing-the-dev-container-configuration)

If you modify `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, Zed does not currently rebuild or reload the container automatically. After changing configuration:

* Stop or kill the existing container manually (e.g., via `docker kill <container>`).
* Reopen the project in the container.

## [Working in a Dev Container](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers.html#working-in-a-dev-container)

Once connected, Zed operates inside the container environment for tasks, terminals, and language servers.
Files are linked from your workspace into the container according to the dev container specification.

## [Known Limitations](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers.html#known-limitations)

> **Note:** This feature is still in development.

* **Extensions:** Zed does not yet manage extensions separately for container environments. The host's extensions are used as-is.
* **Port forwarding:** Only the `appPort` field is supported. `forwardPorts` and other advanced port-forwarding features are not implemented.
* **Configuration changes:** Updates to `devcontainer.json` do not trigger automatic rebuilds or reloads; containers must be manually restarted.
