# [Tab Switcher](https://zed.dev/docs/tab-switcher.html#tab-switcher)

The Tab Switcher provides a quick way to navigate between open tabs in Zed. It
displays a list of your open tabs sorted by recent usage, making it easy to jump
back to whatever you were just working on.

## [Quick Switching](https://zed.dev/docs/tab-switcher.html#quick-switching)

When the Tab Switcher is opened using `ctrl-tab|ctrl-tab`, instead of
running the `tab switcher: toggle` from the command palette, it'll stay
active as long as the `ctrl` key is held down.

While holding down `ctrl`, each subsequent `tab` press cycles to the next item (`shift` to cycle backwards) and, when `ctrl` is released, the selected item is confirmed and
the switcher is closed.

## [Opening the Tab Switcher](https://zed.dev/docs/tab-switcher.html#opening-the-tab-switcher)

The Tab Switcher can also be opened with either `tab switcher: toggle` (`ctrl-tab|ctrl-tab`)
or `tab switcher: toggle all`.

While the Tab Switcher is open, you can:

* Press `down|down` to move to the next tab in the list
* Press `up|up` to move to the previous tab
* Press `enter` to confirm the selected tab and close the switcher
* Press `escape` to close the switcher and return to the original tab from which
  the switcher was opened
* Press `ctrl-backspace|ctrl-backspace` to close the currently selected tab

As you navigate through the list, Zed will update the pane's active item to
match the selected tab.
