### [Safer Bash Shebang Recipes](https://just.systems/man/en/safer-bash-shebang-recipes.html#safer-bash-shebang-recipes)

If you’re writing a `bash` shebang recipe, consider adding `set -euxo pipefail`:

```
foo:
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -euxo pipefail
  hello='Yo'
  echo "$hello from Bash!"
```

It isn’t strictly necessary, but `set -euxo pipefail` turns on a few useful
features that make `bash` shebang recipes behave more like normal, linewise
`just` recipe:

* `set -e` makes `bash` exit if a command fails.
* `set -u` makes `bash` exit if a variable is undefined.
* `set -x` makes `bash` print each script line before it’s run.
* `set -o pipefail` makes `bash` exit if a command in a pipeline fails. This is
  `bash`-specific, so isn’t turned on in normal linewise `just` recipes.

Together, these avoid a lot of shell scripting gotchas.

#### [Shebang Recipe Execution on Windows](https://just.systems/man/en/safer-bash-shebang-recipes.html#shebang-recipe-execution-on-windows)

On Windows, shebang interpreter paths containing a `/` are translated from
Unix-style paths to Windows-style paths using `cygpath`, a utility that ships
with [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com).

For example, to execute this recipe on Windows:

```
echo:
  #!/bin/sh
  echo "Hello!"
```

The interpreter path `/bin/sh` will be translated to a Windows-style path using
`cygpath` before being executed.

If the interpreter path does not contain a `/` it will be executed without
being translated. This is useful if `cygpath` is not available, or you wish to
pass a Windows-style path to the interpreter.
